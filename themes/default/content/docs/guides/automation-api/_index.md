The Pulumi Automation API is a programmatic interface for running Pulumi programs without the CLI. Generally this can be thought of as encapsulating the functionality of the CLI (`pulumi up`, `pulumi preview`, `pulumi destroy`, `pulumi stack init`, etc.) but with more flexibility. This still requires a CLI binary to be installed and available on your PATH environment variable.

In addition to fine-grained building blocks, Automation API provides three out of the box ways to work with Stacks:

1. Programs locally available on-disk and addressed via a filepath (NewStackLocalSource)

    ```go
    stack, err := NewStackLocalSource(ctx, "myOrg/myProj/myStack", filepath.Join("..", "path", "to", "project"))
    ```

2. Programs fetched from a Git URL (NewStackRemoteSource)

    ```go
    stack, err := NewStackRemoteSource(ctx, "myOrg/myProj/myStack", GitRepo{
        URL:         "https://github.com/pulumi/test-repo.git",
        ProjectPath: filepath.Join("project", "path", "repo", "root", "relative"),
    })
    ```

3. Programs defined as a function alongside your Automation API code (NewStackInlineSource)

    ```go
    stack, err := NewStackInlineSource(ctx, "myOrg/myProj/myStack", func(pCtx *pulumi.Context) error {
        bucket, err := s3.NewBucket(pCtx, "bucket", nil)
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
        pCtx.Export("bucketName", bucket.Bucket)
        return nil
    })
    ```

Each of these creates a stack with access to the full range of Pulumi lifecycle methods (up/preview/refresh/destroy), as well as methods for managing config, stack, and project settings.

```go
err := stack.SetConfig(ctx, "key", ConfigValue{ Value: "value", Secret: true })
preRes, err := stack.Preview(ctx)
// detailed info about results
fmt.Println(preRes.prev.Steps[0].URN)
```

The Automation API provides a natural way to orchestrate multiple stacks, feeding the output of one stack as an input to the next as shown in the package-level example below. The package can be used for a number of use cases:

- Driving pulumi deployments within CI/CD workflows

- Integration testing

- Multi-stage deployments such as blue-green deployment patterns

- Deployments involving application code like database migrations

- Building higher level tools, custom CLIs over pulumi, etc

- Using pulumi behind a REST or GRPC API

- Debugging Pulumi programs (by using a single main entrypoint with "inline" programs)

To enable a broad range of runtime customizations, the API defines a `Workspace` interface. A Workspace is the execution context containing a single Pulumi project, a program, and multiple stacks. Workspaces are used to manage the execution environment, providing various utilities such as plugin installation, environment configuration ($PULUMI_HOME), and creation, deletion, and listing of Stacks. Every Stack including those in the above examples are backed by a Workspace which can be accessed via:

```go
w = stack.Workspace()
err := w.InstallPlugin("aws", "v3.2.0")
```

Workspaces can be explicitly created and customized beyond the three Stack creation helpers noted above:

```go
w, err := NewLocalWorkspace(ctx, WorkDir(filepath.Join(".", "project", "path"), PulumiHome("~/.pulumi"))
s := NewStack(ctx, "org/proj/stack", w)
```

A default implementation of workspace is provided as `LocalWorkspace`. This implementation relies on Pulumi.yaml and Pulumi.<stack>.yaml as the intermediate format for Project and Stack settings. Modifying ProjectSettings will alter the Workspace Pulumi.yaml file, and setting config on a Stack will modify the Pulumi.<stack>.yaml file. This is identical to the behavior of Pulumi CLI driven workspaces. Custom Workspace implementations can be used to store Project and Stack settings as well as Config in a different format, such as an in-memory data structure, a shared persistent SQL database, or cloud object storage. Regardless of the backing Workspace implementation, the Pulumi SaaS Console will still be able to display configuration applied to updates as it does with the local version of the Workspace today.

The Automation API also provides error handling utilities to detect common cases such as concurrent update conflicts:

```go
uRes, err :=stack.Up(ctx)
if err != nil && IsConcurrentUpdateError(err) { /* retry logic here */ }
```

## Example

```go
ctx := context.Background()

// This stack creates an output
projA := "projA"
stackName := FullyQualifiedStackName("myOrg", projA, "devStack")
stackA, err := NewStackInlineSource(ctx, stackName, projA, func(pCtx *pulumi.Context) error {
	pCtx.Export("outputA", pulumi.String("valueA"))
	return nil
})
if err != nil {
	// return errors.Wrap(err, "failed to create stackA")
}
// deploy the stack
aRes, err := stackA.Up(ctx)
if err != nil {
	// return errors.Wrap(err, "failed to update bucket stackA")
}

// this stack creates an uses stackA's output to create a new output
projB := "projB"
stackName = FullyQualifiedStackName("myOrg", projB, "devStack")
stackB, err := NewStackInlineSource(ctx, stackName, projB, func(pCtx *pulumi.Context) error {
	// output a new value "valueA/valueB"
	pCtx.Export(
		"outputB",
		pulumi.Sprintf(
			"%s/%s",
			pulumi.String(aRes.Outputs["outputA"].Value.(string)), pulumi.String("valueB"),
		),
	)
	return nil
})
if err != nil {
	// return errors.Wrap(err, "failed to create object stackB")
}
// deploy the stack
bRes, err := stackB.Up(ctx)
if err != nil {
	// return errors.Wrap(err, "failed to update stackB")
}

// Success!
fmt.Println(bRes.Summary.Result)
```
